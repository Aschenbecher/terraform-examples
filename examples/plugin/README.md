Terraform examples for the the Oracle Compute Provider plugin
=============================================================

These examples are for the original Terraform provider **plugin** for Oracle Compute Cloud from https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-compute/provider

The provider plugin can be used with Terraform versions 0.7.x to 0.9.3. For Terraform 0.9.4 and above the `opc` provider is **built-in** to Terraform.

See the [migration guide](../../MIGRATION.md) for details on migrating exisiting configurations and deployments to the new version of the provider.
